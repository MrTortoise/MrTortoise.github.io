install these plugins: see below for some hints.
https://dennisreimann.de/articles/elm-atom-editor.html


1. `elm-format` I haven't managed to stop this giving me a null error on save. However did get it working.
1. put `elm-format` binary into ~/bin and then in settings in atom point it there.
2. Do not -when using ubuntu (or linux with no root) do the sudo chown command here:  https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions (or if you do, snapshot your vm before hand)
3. install the plugin intentions to get alt-enter auto completion of linting problems
4. install linter using `apm install linter`

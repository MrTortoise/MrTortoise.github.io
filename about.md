# Hi

I am a coding, guitaring, go playing parent with way too many interests to fit into the available time.
Whilst not sitting in a cave rolling my face on a keyboard am probably found being a taxi driver / circus master for kids.

I'm a .net guy who likes to play with anything but. Dabble with games engines, actor systems and generally anything that takes my fancy.

## Why am I doing this?

Not really sure. I think so that when i look at my repos in 6 months and wonder 'what the hell was I thinking' I can realise that i probalby wasn't and really was off on some crazy tangent. But hey, if the journey is fun everyones a winner.

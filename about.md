# Who am I?

Primarily, I'm a guy who loves meeting people and businesses, sitting down with them and understanding their problems, their customers and then helping them connect.

Spent nearly 20 years helping businesses build themselves up. Have ran 2 companies, been CTO of 2 more and am currently involved with 3 companies. Have contracted and worked at companies of all sizes from 2 man bands up to large blue chip companies.

Love engaging the community and regularly attend and contribute to tech events.

Run training sessions in Lean, TDD, Mobbing and Event Storming. Big fan of XP approaches.

Currently very interested in getting involved with companies who have got to a point where they want to scale but are finding enacting change harder and harder. A cultural and perspective shift is very likely to be required and I am fascinated about figuring out exactly what is slowing things down.

All seriousness aside I'm a guy who loves to solve problems and build stuff. Constantly dabbling nad learning new technologies and languages.

## Why am I doing this? (Writing blogish posts)

Not really sure. I think so that when I look at my repos in 6 months and wonder 'what the hell was I thinking' I can realise that I probably wasn't and really was off on some crazy tangent. But hey, if the journey is fun everyoneâ€™s a winner.

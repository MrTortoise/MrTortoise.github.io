I"p<p>The background is that I was attempting to to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems">99 prolog problems</a>. All was going well until i hit the permutation / combination problem at question 26. <a href="https://github.com/MrTortoise/elixir_ninety_nine_problems">elixir repo</a></p>

<p>So its 3C2, really easy to do imperatively or by passing a reference to a list about during recursion in an imperative language. Odd never been stumped like this before. After some thought it turns out I hadnâ€™t realised I was creating a tree.</p>

<p>Anyway the point: its like I need to turn the tree inside out.</p>

<p>The problem is that when starting from the source of the tree how to you add items to a list of lists. If you start from the leaves and work back though then it seems doable - and so some kind of accumulator parameter could work.</p>

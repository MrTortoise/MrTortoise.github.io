I"z<p>So I was looking for a way to get github pages to highlight elixir probably in the markup.
I failed at that, but I found this resource instead.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="[https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir]">awesome-elixir</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great list of resources. So much to go at, one of the ones that
intrigued me is a game with React + Redux and Phoenix.
Kind of has all the toys I want to play with.</p>

<p>Anyway I found another resource that I will definable dig into.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="[https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans]">koans-elixir</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this is done well as I think this is a great idea for learning at
least the syntax of a lang.</p>

<p>Update - spent 40 mins on the first 80. Well worth it.
Update 2 - well worth the time. Learnt a ton about various ways different
language elements combine, very enlightening.</p>

<p>I like to solve problems and improve systems.</p>

<p>Love building stuff and making things. Ended up teaching myself to code because its the best way to help most businesses. I am not so sure now, I think businesses now need help figuring out their communication structures and discovering what their customers value.</p>

<p>Constantly dabbling nad learning new technologies and languages.
Currently playing with Elm, Vue, F#, Fable.</p>

<p>Not really sure. I think so that when I look at my repos in 6 months and wonder ‘what the hell was I thinking’ I can realise that I probably wasn’t and really was off on some crazy tangent. But hey, if the journey is fun everyone’s a winner.</p>

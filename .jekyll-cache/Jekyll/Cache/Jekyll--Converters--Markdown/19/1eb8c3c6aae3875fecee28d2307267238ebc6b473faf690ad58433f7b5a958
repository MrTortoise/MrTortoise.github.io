I"¶<p>#Back to Elixir</p>

<p>After nearly a month of no Elixir came back to it after a brief foray into elm.</p>

<p>Here is a list of tutorials I made progress with. Although they are really more like manuals!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html - the info from the source. Good in that it quickly gets you writing code. Bad in that it doesnâ€™t get you running any form of rapid iteration / TDD or project structure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>http://elixirschool.com/ - This introduces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix</code> as its 9th topic. testing shortly after.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I havenâ€™t got to otp yet though!</p>

So I was looking for a way to get github pages to highlight elixir probably in the markup.
I failed at that, but I found this resource instead.

This is a great list of resources. So much to go at, one of the ones that
intrigued me is a game with React + Redux and Phoenix.
Kind of has all the toys I want to play with.


Anyway I found another resource that I will definable dig into.

Hopefully this is done well as I think this is a great idea for learning at
least the syntax of a lang.

Update - spent 40 mins on the first 80. Well worth it.
Update 2 - well worth the time. Learnt a ton about various ways different
language elements combine, very enlightening.

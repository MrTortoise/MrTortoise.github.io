#What does Not Waterfall look Like

##Everyone says wa5terfall is the devil. Why?

Usual reasons:
 - It is slow
 - Customer requirements change
 - It's something everyone says is crap so everyone parrots it.
 - It is not agileRant

All this ignores that waterfall must be good in some situations - the world is a continuous spectrum. At the one end we place Waterfall and at he oter we place Agile.

##So lets build some strawmen

### Strawman to deal with customer requirements changing
Lets pretend that Agile is used when things are uncertain and so complete and total design up front all the way through to execution is the problem.

So if complete certainty Waterfall, and if Complete uncertainty Agile.

####Why do customer requirements change?
These all essentially fall under the category of excuses such as 'The customer changed her mind'
1. Time
 - The world changes, time is simply an abstract quantity that is observable due to the presence of change in the observable world. It is a concept - i'll let the philosphers depate that one.
 - That is, if sufficient time passes then a requirement will change. So the validity of current state is a probabalistic function of at least time. That for me is fascinating.
  - Anyway ... the point. If you go slow, the world will change. I will come back to speed in another strawman.

2. Upon delivery the customer realises that the execution was bad.
3. Upon delivery the customer realises that the solution was bad.
4. Upon delivery the customer realises that extra features are needed.
5. Upon delivery it is discovered nobody wants to use the solution.

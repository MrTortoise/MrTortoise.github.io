#So what is going on?

Have spent a week or so playing with elm. I don't know Haskell and Tb have been kind of watching iZombie and getting into it whilst doing this. But still I am just not feeling it. Seems to be a crap ton of code to accomplish anything.

Moreover because of its abstraction I think it makes me think mi in mvc.net mode and so expect to do things like pass objects around that arenâ€™t in the url. Admittedly that is simply my problem not elm's.

But things i haven't enjoyed.
1. Most examples use some # based routing. I have never seen that in the wild, why would anyone want to?
2. Haven't really seen how to call services yet but have been through several tutorials.
3. I cannot help but think if I sat down and learnt Haskell this would all becomes trivial. However as all this is really a distraction from learning phoenix + elixir to act as the ui layer sitting down and devoting time to Haskell isn't what i want to do right now.
4. I feel like I wrote a lot of code - more than ng/ng2/asp.net/mvc - to accomplish not very much. Sure when it compiles it works ... but when it doesn't compile often you either can fix it - or you are in the abyss of not knowing. It's not like you can (admittedly this is a terrible situation) debug it ...

#Back to Elixir

After nearly a month of no Elixir came back to it after a brief foray into elm.

Here is a list of tutorials I made progress with. Although they are really more like manuals!

1.	http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html - the info from the source. Good in that it quickly gets you writing code. Bad in that it doesnâ€™t get you running any form of rapid iteration / TDD or project structure

2.	http://elixirschool.com/ - This introduces `mix` as its 9th topic. testing shortly after.

I haven't got to otp yet though!

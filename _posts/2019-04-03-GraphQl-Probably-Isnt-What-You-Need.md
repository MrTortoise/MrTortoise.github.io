## What is the Lead here?

Our job as devs is to deliver value to the business - not to enrich the boring dross that we have allowed businesses to turn our jobs into. Maybe picking the latest greatest tech is exactly the least important part of what we should be doing. 

## What is a green field project?

1. A new project that needs everything setup (Deployment, Build, Team, Tech Stack). 
2. A proof of business value

## What is the first thing everyone with a green field project do?

`Look at all the toys!`

Lets use the latest and greatest stack

I want GraphQL, I want React/Vue, lets use some really alpha js features, lets use lots of really helpful libraries to solve all our problems (rather than right some simple sql).

Innovation and learning is great, but what is the cost?
Increased risk of failure with the potential of some extra value

## Where to spend innovation points?

A dev I have a lot of respect for once said to me (whilst I was figuring out my stack to solve some problems in a startup)

`Be aware of how much new stuff you are using, consider that you have a number of innovation points to spend on a particular problem and be aware that they represent liability`

What was awesome about this is that someone who I thought of as a shiny person who was going to totally eclipse me at some point completely dropped a truth bomb on me at a time when I *really* needed to hear it.

### What Do you hope to get out of innovation?

There are many ways to skin every cat. Hopefully you already have many tools to solve any job you encounter. In these situations you need to be asking yourself why do you want to push off from the island of certainty on a Zarathrustrian journey. What exactly are you hoping to get in return for throwing off the shackles of what you know?

- Faster Development time? (but is development time the bottleneck?)
- The ability to scale better? (but this is greenfield - its never going to be 'at scale' unless it succeeds)
- Some undefined better?
- A different abstraction (nothing wrong with different, but unknown needs to have definate value to offset it)

### Are you sure you are not simply bored and using a green field project to learn something new?

Really the fun, interesting and challenging part is figuing out how to get to market in ways that help you learn about what your customers really want.

Spend innovation points on this - its really hard and takes a *lot* of time.

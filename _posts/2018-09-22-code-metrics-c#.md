# C#: Why does nobody have ABC code metric in C#

Anyone who knows me will know I don't think much of code metrics. I don't like anything that gives people an excuse to go into autopilot with decision wise.

I have seen terrible code that scores well in all metrics thrown at it - moreover I am not convinced a lot of devs understand how to use metrics to get good code. The game becomes 'lower the metric - save the cheerleader'

## So imagine my suprise when '99 Bottles of OOP' opens with them

I love working on my coding chops and challenging my assumptions. I also like to think I might be pretty good at some of this stuff. Problem is I am not sure what.

Sandi Metz + Katrina Owen wrote a book and I think it's looking to be very very good.

In a discussion of what good code might look like they have made recourse to code metrics because they at least provide an abstract yet objective point against which a discussion of code can take place - I like that.

## Their favoured metric (for measuring cognitive load) is ABC

ABC measures Assignments, Branches and Conditionals.

It actually looks pretty good and ends up with scores that make seem to marry up against complexity.

## Nobody in the dot net world does it!!!

Seriously, it seems almost every other langauge has it on the first page of google.

Not C# ... why I wonder?

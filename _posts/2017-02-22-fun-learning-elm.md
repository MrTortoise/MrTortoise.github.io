Recently started to play with Elm. Wanted to make a few notes mainly for myself.

## Setup:

https://www.elm-lang./org

## Atom


install these plugins: see below for some hints. https://dennisreimann.de/articles/elm-atom-editor.html

1.	`elm-format` I haven't managed to stop this giving me a null error on save. However did get it working.
2.	put `elm-format` binary into ~/bin and then in settings in atom point it there.
3.	Do not -when using ubuntu (or linux with no root) do the sudo chown command here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions (or if you do, snapshot your vm before hand)
4.	install the plugin intentions to get alt-enter auto completion of linting problems
5.	install linter using `apm install linter`

##Tutorials
1. http://elm-lang.org/docs - didnt fins massivley helpful
2. https://www.elm-tutorial.org - makign good progress with this one.
3. https://www.gitbook.com/book/evancz/an-introduction-to-elm/details - not looked at this one yet. Although tone makes it sound like might be written by the guy who wrote elm.

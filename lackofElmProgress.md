#So what is going on?

Have spent a week or so playing with elm. I don't know haskell and tbh have been kind of watching iZmnbie and getting into it whilst doing this. But still I am just not feeling it. Seems to be a crap ton of code to accomplish anything.

Moreover because of its abstraction i think it makes me think im in mvc.net mode and so expect to do things like pass objects around that arn't in the url. Addmittedly that is simply my problem not elm's.

But things i haven't enjoyed.
1. Most examples use some # based routing. I have never seen that in the wild, why would anyone want to?
2. Haven't really seen how to call services yet but have been through several tutorials.
3. I cannot help but think if i sat down and learn't haskell this would all becomes trivial. However as all this is really a distraction from learning phoneix + elixir to act as the ui layer sitting down and devoting time to haskell isn't what i want to do right now.
4. I feel like i wrote a lot of code - more than ng/ng2/asp.net/mvc - to accomplish not very much. Sure when it compiles it works ... but when it doesn't compile often you either can fix it - or you are in the abyss of not knowing. It's not like you can (admittedly this is a terrible situation) debug it ...

#Back to Elixir - list of tutorials made progress with. So almost 4 weeks of no elixir and i'ts funny how much you forget yet quickly rmember. So back to tutorials, so here is a list of tutorials. Although they are really more like manuals!

1.	http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html - the info from the source. Good in that it quickly gets you writing code. Bad in that it doesnt get you running any form of rapid iteration / tdd or project structure

2.	http://elixirschool.com/ - This introduces `mix` as its 9th topic. testing shortly after.

I have3n't got to otp yet though!
